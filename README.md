## Intro to Job Metric Project
This project is used to analyzed the software engineer's job market.       
We analyzed in 3 aspects from a job's description :      
1. Job's titles : Machine Learning, SDE, Data Scientist......      
2. Job's descriptions : what kind of people employers desire to hire        
3. Job's skill requirements : what kind of skills is popular for those positions       
                  
According to our results, the top 3 positions are :
1. Software Engineer (general)
2. Data Scientist
3. Machine Learning
            
As we analyzed the key words in all jobs' descriptions, we concluded that all positions strongly requires employees know how to **Team-Work**            
              
After we contracted all skill-related information from the raw data set, and we calculated a programming language list which indicates the language that is in high demand :        
1. Python
2. C++
3. Java
4. SQL
5. JavaScript
          
We have referenced with [**Toibe index**](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)
